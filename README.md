# AI-Agent-Notebooks

This repository contains experiments with AI agent frameworks and orchestration, designed to explore the capabilities of AI agents for various tasks.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how AI agents can be orchestrated to perform complex tasks through a cooperative workflow. The agents work together to research, summarize, and fact-check information on specific topics.

## Key Components

- **Agent Configuration**: Defined in `config.yaml` with roles, goals, and backstories for different agent types
- **Agent Types**:
  - Research Agent: Finds relevant information on specified topics
  - Summarization Agent: Condenses research findings into concise summaries
  - Fact-Checking Agent: Verifies the accuracy of information

## Examples

The repository includes Jupyter notebooks demonstrating:
- CrewAI framework for agent orchestration
- Agent collaboration with sequential workflows
- Information processing pipelines using multiple specialized agents
